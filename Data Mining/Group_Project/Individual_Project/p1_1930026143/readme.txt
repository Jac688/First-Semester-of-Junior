How to execute :
1. Just run the code in order in jupyter notebook. The code you should run is all the .ipynb types files.
2. If something goes wrong, just run the code from begining (top of the page).
3. You may need to download some package in pip  and conda e.g. skelen, catboost, graphviz.
4. KNN Model may take two minutes, please wait patiently.
